  I'm a Junior System Engineer with a love for thoughtfully-crafted cli tools, striking graphics and NixOS.<br><br>
  You'll often find me exploring new tools and tweaking configurations to make systems more useable.<br><br>
  I'm fascinated by efficient system management, cyber security, automation and the ways we can make computers work better for us.<br><br>
  The intersection of usability and technical elegance is where I thrive.<br><br>
  I'm currently pursuing my federal Cyber Security Specialist certification while gaining hands-on experience through system administration and my self-hosted servers.<br><br>
  Take a look to see what I've been working on.<br><br>
  If you have any questions or want to know more about me, feel free to go through my website (linked above) and reach out.
